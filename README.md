# Amazon-Web-Scraping
This Python project scrapes the results returned by Amazon for the search 'ultrawide monitor', using the 'BeautifulSoup' library.
It scrapes for four attributes: Description, Price, Rating, Number of Reviews.
'Pandas' is subsequently used to reform the data; remove duplicates and change data-types from 'object' into something actionable.

I intend to perform some statistical analysis on the data at a later date - I was just getting a feel for how to web-scrape in this particular project.
